## 0) Context Anchor — “From Noise to Action, Safely”

**Screen**: Title card.
**Point**: This exists to protect people and institutions by accelerating **responsible** action in service of **peace, pluralism, and social justice**.

**How**: Do not click; let it breathe for 5–10 seconds.

---

## 1) Radar — Today’s Issues (Policy / Industry / Advocacy / Risk)

**Screen**: Radar with four quadrants and confidence for each item.

**Point**: IAMC monitors multiple streams and reduces them to a shared, decision-ready picture.

**Click**: Select the top issue in **Policy** (sample: “Energy Regulation Draft Released”).

---

## 2) Issue of the Day — Executive Brief

**Screen**: Summary + three **risks**, three **opportunities**, three **recommendations**.

**Point**: Clarity and prudence. These are the **highest-leverage actions** for today.

**Click**: Briefly expand **Evidence** (source list with confidence). Don’t linger.

**Note**: Evidence visibility is the credibility anchor; keep it snappy.

---

## 3) Role Lenses — CEO / COO / Director

**Screen**: Tabs with role-specific **actions** and **talking points**.

**Point**: Alignment across leadership lanes prevents drift and mixed messaging.

**Click**: Flip CEO → COO → Director to show specificity without changing the core stance.

---

## 4) Human-in-the-Loop — Interrupt + Dual Sign-off

**Screen**: Review Bar at the top.

**Point**: Nothing can be exported without human review. Safety is visible and simple.

**Demo**:

1. Toggle **Interrupt** ON.
2. Attempt **Export** → system shows **blocked**.
3. Clear **Interrupt** (Resume).
4. Apply **Analyst** **and** **Strategy Head** sign-offs.

**Explicit**: Export remains **disabled until both approvals are green**.

---

## 5) Assets — Audience-Tuned Drafts

**Screen**: LinkedIn, Email, Press Excerpt; audience selector (Board, Members, etc.).

**Point**: IAMC can move from understanding to consistent, credible outreach quickly.

**Click**: Generate assets; toggle audience to show tone adjustments.

---

## 6) ROI² — Time and FTE Reclaimed

**Screen**: Hours saved, FTE equivalent, before/after comparison.

**Point**: Capacity shifts from manual synthesis to verification, outreach, and alliance work.

**Note**: This is illustrative in demo; production uses real baselines.

---

## 7) Last Week + Tweaks — Learning Loop

**Screen**: Upload prior report (PDF/HTML/ZIP), add notes; list stored samples.

**Point**: When something misses, the organization captures it. Outputs get more culturally sensitive and context-aware over time.

**Click**: Upload a sample file; show it listed.

---

## 8) Export — Leave-Behind (Gated)

**Screen**: Export ZIP (brief + assets + HTML/PDF).

**Point**: Auditable closure and a clean handoff to comms and field teams.

**Demo**: With both approvals active and Interrupt off, perform the export. The ZIP downloads.

## Presenter tips

* Mission first, mechanics second.
* Show integrity quick: evidence panel + confidence.
* Perform safety every time: Interrupt block → approvals → allowed export.
* Keep language sober; avoid jargon.
* If asked about internals, answer once, then return to mission/impact.
