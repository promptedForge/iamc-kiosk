## [0:00-0:05] Welcome Screen
"From noise to clarity in 5 minutes. This is what your intelligence team wakes up to daily - hundreds of signals that need to be transformed into actionable insights."

## [0:05-0:12] Role Selection
"Let's sign in as the Media Team. The platform adapts to each user's role, showing only relevant intelligence. 

Welcome, Media Team. Let's head to your dashboard."

## [0:12-0:20] Intelligence Dashboard Overview
"Here's your Intelligence Brief - everything that's happened since you last logged in, just 5 minutes ago. 

Notice how the platform has already analyzed patterns across four key areas: Policy, Industry, Advocacy, and Risk. Each item shows priority levels and confidence scores."

## [0:20-0:28] Processing Feed
"Down here is the real magic - the Processing Feed. Watch as 15 different intelligence sources are being analyzed in real-time. Blue dots are incoming, yellow means processing, and green means fully analyzed and ready for review."

## [0:28-0:35] Navigating to Issue
"Let's drill into this critical farmers subsidy issue. The platform has already identified it as high priority based on multiple converging signals."

## [0:35-0:45] Issue Brief & Perspectives
"Here's the full brief - risks, opportunities, and recommendations. Notice how everything is editable. 

Watch as we switch perspectives - from CEO view to COO. The talking points and actions automatically adjust to each executive's needs."

## [0:45-0:55] Asset Generation
"Now let's generate communication assets. Even with AI offline, the platform uses smart templates to create LinkedIn posts, email copy, and press statements - all tailored to your selected audiences."

## [0:55-0:62] ROI Impact
"Here's the impact - 2.3 hours saved today alone. That's like having an extra quarter of an FTE on your team. What used to take 3 hours now takes just 45 minutes."

## [0:62-0:72] Export & Dual Signoff
"For sensitive materials, we require dual signoff. Watch as we switch to the Strategy Head role. The platform enforces governance while keeping the workflow smooth."

## [0:72-0:80] Strategy View & Learning Loop
"From the Strategy Head perspective, you see different intelligence priorities. 

And here's how the system gets smarter - upload last week's brief with your feedback, and the platform learns your preferences for next time."

## [0:80-0:90] Closing
"That's the IAMC platform - transforming information overload into strategic clarity in under 5 minutes. Your team stays ahead of the narrative, not chasing it.

From noise to clarity. From reactive to proactive. That's intelligence at the speed of business."
